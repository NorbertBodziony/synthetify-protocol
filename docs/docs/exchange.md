### How to exchange assets

To see what assets are available to be changed, expand the list by clicking the _Select a token_ button.

At the top of the modal, you can type in an asset you are searching for. Once you choose something, the text is replaced with the chosen asset name and icon.

### Asset to sell

In the _From_ section, you can choose the asset you want to sell. In the top right corner, you can see information about the balance in the chosen asset. _Set to max_ button fills the field with the maximum available amount of the asset.

If you know how much of an asset you want to have after the transaction is completed, but you do not know how much needs to be sold, go to the [_To_](/docs/exchange#asset-to-buy) section.

### Asset to buy

In the _To_ section, you can choose the asset you want to buy. Due to market price fluctuations, the amount of an asset is an estimated value. If you filled the amount in the _From_ field you can see how much of an asset you will get. _Set to max_ button fills the field with the maximum available amount of the asset.

If you know how much of an asset you need to have after the transaction is completed, but you do not know how much needs to be bought, go to the [_From_](/docs/exchange#asset-to-sell) section.

Between _From_ and _To_ section, there is a swap array. It swaps assets places. After that, the asset which was in _From_, will be in _To_ and conversely for the second asset.
