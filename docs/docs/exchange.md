### Asset to sell

In _From_ section you can choose the asset you want to sell. In the top right corner you can see information about the balance in the chosen asset. _Set to max_ button fills the field with maximum available amount of the asset.

If you know how much asset you want to have after the transaction is completed, but you do not know how much needs to be sold, go to [_To_](/docs/exchange#asset-to-buy) section.

### Asset to buy

In _To_ section you can choose the asset you want to buy. Due to market price fluctuacion, the amount of asset is an estimated value. If you filled the amount in _From_ field you can see how much asset you will get. _Set to max_ button fills the field with maximum available amount of the asset.

If you know how much asset you need to have after the transaction is completed, but you do not know how much needs to be bought, go to [_From_](/docs/exchange#asset-to-sell) section.

Between _From_ and _To_ section, there is a swap array. It swaps assets places. After that, asset which was in _From_, will be in _To_ and conversely for the second asset.
