### Smart Contract

Almost all Synthetify functionalities are deployed with one smart contract. The only exception is providing price data.

### SPL-token

All synthetic assets are [SPL-token](https://spl.solana.com/token) based, which enables further usage on other platforms like AMM's with nearly frictionless integration.

### Pyth Oracle

Pyth Oracle provides prices of underlying assets from decentralized oracles.
