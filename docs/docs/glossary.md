### Deposit

Deposit takes tokens from user wallet and adds it to user's account as a [collateral](#collateral)

### Dept

Minting tokens adds debt to account as a shares in the debt pool. As total debt can change, debt of user can as well.

### Max debt

After user debt exceeds max debt user can be [liquidated](#liquidation)

### Mint

Synthetic assets can be created by Stakers of the platform and then exchanged on Synthetify exchange. Exchange of two different synthetic assets is direct, even for pairs that do not exist on centralized exchanges e.g. xFTT -> xSRM instead of FTT -> USD -> SRM which results in lower exchange fees and no slippage.

### Mint limit

Maximum amount you can mint calculated from [collateral](#collateral).
<!-- To ensure safety of the platform each asset has a predefined but adjustable limit of the amount of tokens that can be created. -->

### Withdraw

Deposited collateral can be transferred to user's wallet by withdraw.

### Burn

Synthetic tokens can be burned by Stakers to reduce their debt and free collateral tokens.

### Rewards

For participating in debt pool you get some SNY token. Details of getting it are [here](/docs/staking#rewards).

### Collateral

Deposited tokens become collateral. It is stored inside the account and allows a user to [mint](#mint) tokens and to have debt. You can find more about collateral [here](/docs/technical/collateral)

### Collateral Ratio

Locked collateral to the value of minted tokens is called a collateral ratio.

### Liquidation

Liquidation means a collateral decrease by asset burn. To ensure platform stability Stakers can be liquidated and part of their collateral will be transferred to Liquidators in exchange for paying back part of a Staker debt. It takes place every time overrunning the collateral ratio occurs.

### Risk

The user can remove provided liquidity at any time. However there are a few risks which can affect locked assets.

#### Market risk

Market risk is a possibility to experience losses due to price change. Cryptocurrency market is very volatile. Even 15% APY could not cover sharp market movement price change.

#### Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is a potential issue especially on micro-cap assets. It could happen that exchanging earned asset will be obstructed because of liquidity on the market.

#### Rewards Loss Risk

There are three stages of providing liquidity:

1. Subscription
2. Staking
3. Claiming.

In phase 1 and 3 there is no possibility to lose staked assets. Earning rewards takes place during stage 2. Staking phase takes two weeks. During this stage the user can freely withdraw its deposit. However burning is bounded with losing earned rewards.

### Listing new assets

Adding new assets to Synthetify exchange requires existence of a reliable price oracle for this asset. Currently, Synthetify team controls what assets are listed on the exchange but in the future this decision will be moved to governance instance.
